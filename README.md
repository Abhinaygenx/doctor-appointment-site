About this project
ðŸ©º Doctor Appointment Website â€“ Simple Description
This is a useful doctor appointment website. The project has three parts: the backend, the frontend, and the admin panel.

Users can sign up and log in easily. After logging in, they can visit pages like Home, All Doctors, About, and Contact.

On the All Doctors page, users can filter doctors by specialization. When a doctor is selected, it takes the user to that doctorâ€™s profile page, where they can book an appointment date.

If the user changes their mind, they can go to their profile page and cancel the appointment.

The admin panel has some special features:

Add new doctors

Add doctorâ€™s education, specialization, and profile picture

I built this project in three weeks. It took some time, but it helped me learn a lot and improve my skills.
